# APDD: Aesthetics of Paintings and Drawings Dataset

This is an open-source aesthetics of paintings and drawings dataset called APDD, which was completed by the victory-lab.

## Introduction

The construction of a multi-attribute, multi-category dataset in the field of painting aesthetics represents a pioneering new task. Through close collaboration with approximately 60 global professional artists and students with high academic qualifications, we have successfully established a clear system for considering the aesthetic components of art images. We initially categorized the field of painting into 24 artistic categories and 10 aesthetic attributes, meticulously defining scoring criteria for corresponding attributes within different artistic categories. We have created the APDD dataset, the most broadly categorized and attribute-rich dataset in the field of painting, comprising 4,985 images of various painting types, accompanied by over 31,100 annotations for both total aesthetic scores and aesthetic attribute scores.

## Files

- `APDD.csv`: This file contains annotations for the APDD dataset, including artistic categories, total aesthetic scores, and aesthetic attribute scores for 4,985 images.
- `filesource.csv`: This file records the source URLs for 1892 images in the APDD dataset. The remaining images are sourced from Wikiart (https://www.wikiart.org/) and student painting assignments.
